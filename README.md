# Movie_Recommendation_WebApp
I made a full-stack web app. I used Front-end: Html,Css,Javascript  Back-end: PHP,XAMPP controller, Apache server, MySql database.
User can register in the system and these data collect in Mysql Database. All movie data comes from TMDB Api and shows movie card.
Api give us some movie info like Overview, Title, Imdb_vote, Movie_Img . Movie Recommender page works like a survey. 
End of the survey it going to give movie by your answer. User can send a message for ideas.
